Order of the Red Poppy
======================

for Minecraft 1.8 (website coming soon)

About

Long ago a secret society was formed under an oppressive King.  Skilled craftsmen struggled to earn a living under unfair, heavy taxes.  They were often cheated and abused by the very kingdom they helped build.  

The various crafting guilds banded together in secret and worked to change their futures.  Together they accomplished amazing feats and unlocked crafting recipes that produced powerful items and artifacts.  They helped the kingdom enter a new golden age.

Time passes and kingdoms fall.  Theirs was no exception, all lost through the ages.  
However, these secrets are not lost forever.  They are waiting to be rediscovered.

It all starts with a book and a red poppy.
